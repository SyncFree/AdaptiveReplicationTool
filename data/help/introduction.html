		<p>This tool for Adaptive Replication is a Java GUI tool that emulates as 
		many Data Centres (DCs) as the have been set in the configuration file 
		(XML file) and shows in which DC replicas are kept and their strength. 
		The strength is an indication of how long the replica may be kept in a 
		DC. The access of the data, when reading and writing it, affects the 
		likelihood that the data will be replicated in the DC, if it is not 
		already replicated in that DC, or removed from a DC with a replica.</p>
		

		<h2>Principles</h2>
		<p>A common technique to reduce latency is the replication of data between 
		different data centres in a system with multiple data centres distributed 
		around the world, as shown in Figure 1.</p>

		<p>But keeping multiple replicas is an expensive commodity given the 
		increase in storage requirements and write operations as a write need to 
		be propagated to all the other data centres with a replica. The data could 
		be placed in only one data centre, in which case there is not any 
		replication, or a copy could exist in all the available data centres, 
		which it is known as full replication. Alternatively the data may be 
		located in some but not necessarily all the data centres such that the 
		number, location and data is determined at run time, which it is known 
		as adaptive replication.</p>

		<p>The replications may be grouped, base on its existence, into two types; 
		<b>static replication</b> where a replica persist until it is deleted by
		a user or its duration expires, and <b>dynamic replication</b> where the
		creation and deletion of a replica are managed automatically and normally
		directed by the access pattern of the data used by the users. In static
		replication the major drawback is their inability to adapt to changes in
		the access pattern of the data used by the users.</p>

		<p>Also there are two types of replication based on their effect on the 
		data; <b><a href="#patial_data_replication">partial data replication</a></b> 
		is concerned with the number of parts 
		the full data is composed of, all of which may be located in different 
		parts of the overall system, i.e. data centres, within a data centre in 
		different nodes or at the client-side, whereas 
		<b><a href="#adaptive_georeplication">adaptive geo--replication</a></b> 
		is concerned in what data and where the data or part of the data is 
		located within the overall system of data centres and how many replicas 
		exist simultaneously.</p>


		<a name="patial_data_replication"></a><h3>Partial Data Replication</h3>
		<p>It is concerned with the different parts of the data, and finding data 
		types that allow breaking the data into smaller parts. It avoids 
		replicating large data structures so helping to reduce the bandwidth and 
		latency. The main principal is that not all the full data is always 
		required, as shown in Figure 2. This introduces the need to find data 
		structures which allow breaking the data into parts without loosing 
		information, and maintaining the data integrity and required invariants.<p>

			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>This requires to define new Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) 
		which allows splitting the data into different parts that may be placed 
		in multiple data centres.</p>


		<a name="adaptive_georeplication"></a><h3>Adaptive Geo-replication</h3>
		<p>This is  also know as ``Adaptive Location of Replicas". In the example 
		shown in Figure \ref{fig:adaptive_location_replicas} data reads/writes to 
		data centres 1 and 2 make the data replica to move from data centre 3 to 
		data centre 1 and 2 ensuring that the data is closer to where the reads 
		and writes are requested based on the specified objectives and constraints.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td align="center">
					<p>Example of adaptive geo--replication between data centre.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>Adaptive Geo--replication is concerned with:</p>
		<table border=0>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top"><u>Location</u>:</td>
				<td>On which data cetre to place the replicas so it is
					<p>- Improved the latency: reduce distance between user and replica,</p>
					<p>- Improved the data transmission quality.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top"><u>Selection</u>:</td>
				<td>Which data to replicate.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top"><u>Number<u>:</td>
				<td>How many replicas to have so it is
					<p>- Reduced unnecessary replicas which </p>
						<p> * Reduces storage consumption and<p>
						<p> * Reduces required network bandwidth.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>In general terms any read operation in a data centre reinforces the need 
		for a replica of the data in such data centre, similarly but perhaps with 
		a different degree it happens with the write operations. But write operations 
		decrease the need for a replica of the data in the other data centres with 
		replicas, so eventually these data centres will not have any replica of 
		the data. Given that we do not want to keep replicas when there are not 
		necessary replica strength will decay as time pass, but always making sure 
		that the data is present (replicated) at least in a pre-set number of 
		data centres. There is also a question about how the replication should 
		decay as time pass, e.g. linear, exponential or arctangent.</p>
